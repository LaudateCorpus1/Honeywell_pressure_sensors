# Measure sensor ABPDANT015PGAA5 
**Version :** 1.0

Due to the nature of the sensor, it can be connected to any analog port of a microcontroller, e.g port A0 in an arduino.

**Considerations :** Sensor need a voltaje of supply of 5 [v], since arduino have a 10 bits resolution analogs
ports we have :

* Vsupply = 1023 
* Vmin = 0
* Pressure max = 15 psi.
* Pressure min = 0 psi.
* Pressure apply came from clearing the pressure from tranfer function it can be found on datasheet
